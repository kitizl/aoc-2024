# advent of code 2024

solutions for advent of code 2024, written primarily in python.

i would like to try and do some of these problems in other languages soon
(perhaps lua, because that's something i wanted to get into), but for now, the
goal is to use python and write code with some semblance of best practices
that's not just me throwing code at a problem and praying for the best

former commits used to have the data and test cases explicitly, i have
since attempted to remove all of those following the request of the author
of advent of code.
